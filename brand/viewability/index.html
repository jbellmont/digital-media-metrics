              is the percentage (%) of the total number of 
              <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impressions</a> 
              served that were "in-view" to the user. The definition of "in-view" 
              is a hotly debated subject, but the current most widely adopted standard 
              is from the MRC (Media Ratings Council) is the following:

              <li><b>Video ads:</b> 50% of the ad (pixels) has to be served above

                post-ad render

            </p>
            <p>Viewability was introduced to allow advertisers and agencies to 
              measure how much of the display and <a href="/brand/video-views/index.html">
                video impressions</a> they were buying, were actually being served 
                and had the chance to be seen. Before, you had to trust that a 
                publisher would serve <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impressions</a> 
                above the folder. This was a key issue when programmatic buying 
                methods were first introduced, as often the inventory available 
                was remnant, i.e. low quality, below the fold 
                <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impressions</a> 
                the direct advertisers were not buying. 
              </p>
            <p>Nowadays, viewability is a key metric that programmatic traders 
              and buyers focus on when managing campaigns. All major DSPs will 
              report on it, alongside third party ad verification vendors such 
              as Integral Ad Science or MOAT.

        <h2>
          What is a good viewability rate? What are the benchmarks? 
        </h2>
        <p>This is a tricky question as ultimately it depends on what your campaign 
          goals are. If it is brand focused, and you want to reach your target 
          audience (not necessarily wanting them to 
          <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">click</a>) and 
          catch their attention, then you want to optimise your programmatic bidding 
          to high in-view placements. 60% - 70%+ viewability should be a minimum.
        </p>
        <p>If you goal is more <a href="/performance/index.html" target="_blank">
          performance</a> based, if you want a user to 
          <a href="/performance/conversion/index.html" target="_blank">convert</a> 
          or visit your website, then you should not worry as much about viewability 
          compared to <a href="/brand/index.html" target="_blank">branding campaigns</a>. 
          This is because it is very hard to optimise towards both 
          <a href="/performance/index.html" target="_blank">performance</a> AND 
          viewability. As a <a href="/performance/index.html" target="_blank">performance</a> 
          advertiser, you can afford to bid and win lower viewability 
          <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impressions</a> 
          if the <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impressions</a> 
          that you are winning are driving business results. 
        </p>
        <p>Despite seeming counter-intuitive, having a high overall viewability, 
          serving ads that are more likely to be served above the fold in key 
          positions of a website, may not drive 
          <a href="/performance/index.html" target="_blank">performance</a> goals 
          (i.e. <a href="/performance/conversion/index.html" target="_blank">
            conversions</a> or <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">
              clicks</a>). You must find the right balance between a strong 
              viewability level and <a href="/performance/index.html" target="_blank">
                performance</a> goals (CPA, CPC, etc.).

            <h2>
              Why do I have a low viewability?
            </h2>
            <p>Remember, low viewability (i.e. 50%) may not be a bad thing if the 
              50% of the ads served in view are driving a strong performance in 
              regards to your KPI. However viewability is one of your main objectives, 
              then there are a number of reasons why it could be low.
            </p>
            <p>First off, if you are running a programatic display or video campaign, 
              you may simply be bidding too low in your DSP. The lower the bid, 
              the more likely you will win the less desirable inventory, which is 
              often found below the fold on publishers’ websites. 
            </p>            
            <p>You also may be bidding and optimising towards another objective 
              so for your bid, the DSP is prioritising other metrics over viewability. 
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, you should review how long it takes for your ad to load. 
              If it is heavy and uses rich media (video and other heavy animation), 
              then the ad might not be loading time for your verification solution 
              to register the ad in-view. Look to using simpler ads, switch to HTML5 
              creative as standard and optimise the creative so that it is a smaller 
              file size. Non-IAB standard formats sometimes have trouble recording 
              viewabilty correctly so always check with your verification supplier 
              rep for any in depth troubleshooting. 
            </p>            
            <p>We recommend reviewing the "time-in-view” metric (Integral Ad Science 
              offers this: 
              <a href="https://integralads.com/capabilities/time-in-view/" target="_blank">https://integralads.com/capabilities/time-in-view/</a>) 
              to see how long your ads were actually in-view. This is crucial for 
              video campaigns - how do you know if your video ad is always playing 
              in-view?

        <h2>
          How do I improve the viewability of my campaign?
        </h2>
        <p>The main way of improving your campaign viewability 
          will be by optimising (increasing) bids to the sitelists, inventory 
          and supply sources, audiences and ad formats that are driving the 
          strongest rate. This has to be done in relation to the maximum bid you 
          planned the campaign at as increasing the bid to get perfect 100% viewability 
          will increase your <a href="/brand/CPM/index.html" target="_blank">CPM</a> 
          to levels far higher than you originally set out with. 
        </p>
        <p>Other ways involve buying impressions on a vCPM (viewable cost per 1000 
          impressions). You will pay a premium, but every 
          <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impression</a> 
          measured out of view by your third party supplier will not be billed 
          to you. This means you will only pay for in-view 
          <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impressions</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>If you are buying video <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">
          impressions</a>, we recommend you also pay a premium for video formats 
          that pause out of view. If not, the video will likely play even if the 
          users scrolls past it and it goes out of view.
