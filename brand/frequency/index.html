            <h2>
              What is frequency in marketing?
            </h2>
            <p>Advertising frequency is the number of times an ad or 
              <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impression</a> 
              has been served, per unique user. Frequency is a key metric for 
              <a href="/brand/index.html" target="_blank">brand campaigns</a>, 
              especially when calculating to see how many times someone in your 
              target audience has been exposed to a ad. We discuss the optimum 
              frequency level for your objective and how you should set a frequency 
              cap in the section below.
            </p>
            <p>Frequency - alongside <a href="/brand/reach/index.html" target="_blank">reach</a>
               - were the classic media metrics that were used to calculate delivery
                across offline channels such a television and print. While they 
                were estimates, they were commonly accepted and used to base 
                judgements on how much budget should be used for certain media
                 channels and vendors. 
            </p>
            <p>In the digital world, this has moved on substantially, especially 
              as we are now able to report on very granular levels of delivery data. 
              This however, comes with a caveat - it is becoming increasingly 
              harder to accurately measure frequency as the number of devices the 
              average person uses on a day-to-day basis has increased tenfold. 
              With the proliferation of devices comes the challenge of accurately 
              tracking exposure to a campaign (as it is hard to link a single user 
              to multiple devices) when cross-device targeting has not been 100% 
              solved. 
            </p>
            <p>The message here is that use the frequency metric as a guide, rather
               than an absolute truth - if it looks high then you are most likely
                spamming users, annoying them and ultimately damaging your brand. 
                If it is too low, are users being exposed enough to take on your 
                campaign message?

            <h2>
              Frequency capping
            </h2>
            <p>What is the perfect frequency? This is not a question that has an 
              answer, but when thinking about the average frequency you wish your 
              campaign to deliver, you will want to link it back to your campaign 
              objectives and take into consideration how past campaign frequency 
              numbers influenced sales or brand metrics. A low frequency will 
              ensure that you are reaching a wider group of users, while a high 
              frequency narrows your reach, but boosts the exposure your users 
              will have to the campaign.
            </p>
            <p>We recommend imposing a frequency cap every time you run a campaign, 
              always basing it on your campaign objective. Frequency capping limits 
              the number of times a user will be exposed to an ad, over a period 
              of time defined by the system you are using to buy ads. This could 
              be set at a lifetime level, a weekly level or even daily. Whatever 
              you choose, always have the user’s experience in mind. How often 
              would you want to see an ad before it starts to annoy you? 
            </p>
            <p>Different targeting tactics will also influence your frequency cap. 
              When re-targeting users who are warmer prospects, you will want to 
              impose a higher frequency cap to nudge users to convert. If they 
              are a cold prospect and they are not interested in the brand, you 
              could be doing more harm than good if you continue to target them 
              with a too high frequency. 
            </p>
            <p>For <a href="/brand/index.html" target="_blank">branding campaigns</a>, 
              we would recommend a frequency cap of 3 ads per week. For performance 
              campaigns, we would recommend the same frequency cap for prospecting, 
              while increasing it for re-targeting strategies, ensuring that you 
              exclude an audience who have finally converted. This way you will 
              not annoy users who have already converted - an issue re-targeting 
              advertisers tend to forget.

      <!-- Section - Facebook Reach & Freq buying -->
      <section>
        <h2>
          Facebook reach and frequency buying
        </h2>
        <p>DSPs and buying systems will let the media buyer decide how often 
          they want their ads to be served to each user (frequency capping). 
          On Facebook, there is an entire buying method called Facebook Reach 
          and Frequency, which gives the buyer more control over campaign delivery. 
          It is designed to serve ads to the maximum number of users as possible, 
          within your target audience, in the Facebook ecosystem. 
        </p>
        <p>With reach and frequency buying, the buyer is able to control the 
          minimum number of days before the same user is exposed to your ad 
          again and how many times each person sees it, through capping the 
          frequency. 
        </p>
        <p>Outside of reach and frequency buying, a user can only impose a 
          Facebook frequency cap via auction buying using “reach” or “brand 
          awareness” objectives. If you have 
          <a href="/brand/index.html" target="_blank">brand campaign</a> 
          objectives, we recommend you stick to reach and frequency buying 
          to ensure you know upfront exactly how many users you are likely 
          to hit and at what frequency.
