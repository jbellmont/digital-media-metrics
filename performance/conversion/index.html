              What is a conversion in digital marketing?
            </h2>
            <p>In digital marketing, a conversion is an event that is tracked and 
              recorded when a campaign goal or interaction is complete. In a lot 
              of cases this will mean a sale. 
            </p>
            <p>For example, if a user <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">
              clicks</a> on a PPC search ad and buys a t-shirt from the landing 
              on the advertiser page, that would count as a sales conversion. A 
              conversion is tracked via a conversion pixel - javascript code that 
              fires when a conversion event has been triggered - which communicates 
              to the ad server or system informing it that a conversion has occurred. 
              This conversion will then be attributed to the ad that influenced 
              the conversion (please see below for different types of conversion 
              attribution).
            </p>
            <p>Other conversion types could include 
              <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">clicks</a> 
              on a URL, a landing page visit, a newsletter sign-up, a white paper 
              or brochure download, or a telephone call via a number that is 
              linked to the digital campaign. Any trackable action or event that 
              the marketer can add a conversion pixel to will count as a conversion.
            </p>
            <p>In analytics systems (e.g. Google Analytics), these are often 
              referred to as “events” rather than conversions. 
            </p>

        <p>To estimate the number of conversions, you will need the following

        <p>1. <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">Impressions</a> 
          or <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">clicks</a>

      <!-- Section - Why is it important to track conversions? -->
      <section>
        <h2>
          Why is it important to track conversions?
        </h2>
        <p>The primary reason for tracking conversions is to understand the efficacy 
          of each digital channel, vendor or ad. For example, if you run an e-commerce 
          website and do not know which of your ads are driving sales, you could 
          be potentially making poor use of your budget. Once conversion tracking 
          is set up, you will be able to understand which tactic or strategy is 
          driving the most efficient or highest value conversions. As you test 
          and learn, you will be able to confidently shift budget to better 
          performing areas to make the most effective use of your marketing spend. 
        </p>
        <p>Alongside conversions, it is important to measure the conversion rate 
          (of <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impressions</a> 
          or <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">clicks</a> 
          to conversions) and the <a href="/performance/CPA/index.html" target="_blank">
            cost per acquisition (CPA)</a> to fully understand how hard your activity 
            is working.
        </p> 
        <p>You should set up and track conversions in a way that reflects your 
          marketing funnel. Once you have your funnel fully tracked, you will be 
          able to understand where people are dropping off as they are pushed down 
          the funnel as well as create lookalike audiences from the high value 
          converters.

              Click-through and View-through Conversions
            </h2>
            <p>There are two types of conversions that are typically tracked in 
              ad servers: click-through and view-through conversions, also referred 
              to as post-click or post-view conversions. 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Click-through conversions (or post-click)</b> are conversions 
                that were driven from a user 
                <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">clicking</a> 
                on your ad and then converting then or at a later date (within 
                your defined conversion window). 
              </li>
              <li><b>View-through conversions (or post-view)</b> are conversions 
                that were driven from a user being served your ad, not 
                <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">clicking</a> 
                on it, and then converting then or at a later date (within your 
                defined conversion window). This type of conversion was borne 
                from the need to attribute ads (such as digital display banners, 
                that generate fewer amounts of 
                <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">clicks</a> 
                compared to other digital channels) that were seen and may have 
                influenced the sale at a later date. Even if the user saw the 
                ad but did not <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">
                  click</a>, he or she could be subconsciously influenced to 
                  convert at a later date. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If view-through conversions are ignored, you could be not giving 
              enough credit to the digital channels or formats that are influencing 
              a conversion. Both types must be tracked and considered when 
              evaluating the results of a campaign.

      <section>
        <h2>
          Conversion window
        </h2>
        <p>A conversion window is set up to define the number of days or time 
          that the <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impression's</a> 
          influence will be valid for to count towards influencing a conversion. 
          For both types of conversions (click and view), users often do not convert 
          at the time of being served the ad. This means we need to define a window 
          of influence that we feel is enough time for the user to still be influenced 
          by it before converting.
        </p>
        <p>If this window is too long, we may be giving too much credit to the ad 
          if a user converts, for example, 30 days in the future, when in reality 
          the influence of the ad might have worn off by then. For the inverse with 
          a too smaller window, may be under-attributing the effect of the ad. 
        </p>
        <p>When defining a conversion window, you should take into consideration 
          the purchase or converting cycle of the product or service. A more expensive 
          product will likely need a longer attribution window as people take longer 
          to research and consider than a lower cost item before converting. 
        </p>

      <!-- Section - Conversion attribution -->
      <section>
        <h2>
          Conversion attribution
        </h2>
        <p>Conversion attribution falls into either single-touch or multi-touch. 
          Single-touch only looks at one ad 
          <a href="/brand/impression/index.html" target="_blank">impression</a> 
          while multi-touch takes into account multiple channels and ads.
        </p>
        <p>Instead of looking at single conversions in isolation, setting up multi-touch 
          conversion attribution will help you understand the path to conversion 
          and which touchpoints the user was exposed to throughout the journey. 
          In the real world, the user will be likely exposed to many ads before 
          finally converting; conversion attribution modelling will alleviate 
          these shortfalls. 
        </p>
        <p>In multi-touch attribution, giving different weightings to each channel 
          or touchpoint allows you attribute the conversion across multiple 
          touchpoints rather than the one that the user saw last before converting.
        </p>
        <p>The most commonly used single-touch and multi-touch conversion attribution 
          models are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Last click:</b> the last ad that the user 
            <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">clicked</a> 
            on will be attributed the conversion, despite potentially being served 
            multiple ads beforehand that are now not given any credit
          </li>
          <li><b>First click:</b> the first ad that the user 
            <a href="/performance/click/index.html" target="_blank">clicked</a> 
            on will be attributed the conversion, regardless of any ad that was 
            served afterwards
          </li>
          <li><b>Multi-touch:</b> the act of giving multiple touchpoints credit 
            throughout the purchase journey
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li><b>Linear:</b> each touch point is given an equal proportion 
                of the attribution
              </li>
              <li><b>Time decay:</b> the touchpoint that was closest to conversion 
                will receive a higher share of the attribution
              </li>
              <li><b>Cross-device:</b> using probabilistic or determinitic modelling, 
                you would track the number of devices and ads a user was exposed 
                to before converting
              </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
